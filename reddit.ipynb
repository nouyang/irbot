So when I got back from my trip two days ago I decided to go to her house, and I told her everything I saw and of course she made up a thousand excuses. And being honest that pissed me off because she was playing the victim, and I wasn't going to believe that shit, so I told her to stop lying but she kept lying and lying and she was getting on my nerves, so I started crying because it hurt me to see how she was lying like we hadn't been best friends for years. And apparently that made her mad, because she started saying so many horrible things that I couldn't even believe she was saying that.\n",

And she knows that perfectly well but she kept saying things like that anyway. She told me that I hooked up with him because I wanted to prove to her that I can also get what I want. But that's not true, I never planned any of this, it just happened, but according to her I'm the psychopath who harassed him and trapped him with a baby that he didn't want. Which is also a lie because our baby was planned and she knows that too, so I don't know why she was saying those things. It's like she's gone crazy or something.\n",

She was there when I took my pregnancy test, when I was pregnant, and even when my daughter was born, and those moments were really important in my life and she knew it, so I dont know what happened to her reacting like this she is acting like a psycho and it honestly scares me. If my husband didn't reject her, was she going to sleep with him while pretending to be my friend? Just thinking about it makes me feel sick to my stomach. \n",
