280,"because he's married, would be my guess",! he appears and disappears. stops responding at bizarre intervals. I’m pretty sure he’s not making an effort to be consistent and is therefore not interested :/ but he sounds so sincere when he’s actually talking to me :/ what does it mean that he’s “emotionally confused”? What is this behavior?
281,I totally thought that at first,"because he's married, would be my guess"
282,">I feel detached from the situation enough to recognize that HE might be the one who isn’t acting right as opposed to me

You're absolutely right",Why does he vanish and reappear?
284,> She keeps telling me I'm so insecure,": my gf feels we don't have a same vibe anymore, I don't want her to feel hurt while telling me she loves me. How should I make her feel better?"
286,Have a talk about what happened and how it made you feel,My gf  feels something has changed after not being able to talk for a week.
287,I did,Have a talk about what happened and how it made you feel
288,So it sounds like you went out with friends and had some drinks and a good time while she was 900km away? Nothing wrong with that and she sounds like she's just jealous if I'm honest,! My 25M Gf 26F just left me in the restaurant alone and didn't contact for 2 days . She did it knowing I am insecure about this very thing.
290,She didn't contact you or she's acting like nothing happened? I'm sorry your story doesnt much sense,My 25M Gf 26F just left me in the restaurant alone and didn't contact for 2 days . She did it knowing I am insecure about this very thing.

292,Just out of curiosity I looked through your post history,- my husband refuses to negotiate disagreements and takes it an extreme in one direction or the other.
293,Thanks for the feedback,Just out of curiosity I looked through your post history
294,Malicious compliance,Husband takes things to extremes when i try to communicate certain wants
295,I am sure there are a lot of people that could accuse me or that 😕,Malicious compliance
296,I highly doubt you’ll regret cutting her off,: Friend is invisible when I need her. Should I cut off or am I expecting too much?
298,"so it sould be asked, is there anything more than a friendship between you first and I personally would not continue a friendship where I have been the one to initiate all contact between us",Should I  cut off my close friend ?

300,Well think of it like this,"! - Boyfriend takes hours to reply to texts and I begin to feel unwanted and not respected because of that. He also doesn't find it necessarily to get back to his family (mother, sister) in a decent amount of time, as he enjoys to live in the moment and doesn't like the feeling of being restricted of his freedom."
301,that helps to think a bit different!,Well think of it like this
302,"Why is him replying fast so important to you? I get that it's annyoing if he completely forgets to text back but what on earth does ""replying in a decent time"" even mean? He allready stated how he looks at his phone and I understand him well",Boyfriend  has a habit of replying late to the texts and it starts to annoy me
304,Have you told him how you feel about the picture thing? You should really talk to him about that first and see if he’s willing to stop? I I know some guys will probably say you’re overreacting but if you have past trauma with your previous relationships he should understand,I struggle with extremly jealousy for minor stuff and want to become better so it wont ruin my entire day everytime it happens.
306,But honestly just be confident with yourself that’s really important,"I struggle with extreme jealousy, and intrusive thoughts about my bf"

321,Well we were talking just as friends because we live in different cities,"You talked for a year and it was moving too fast? Tried to break up, didn't, then cheated on him"
322,The big issue that you seem to have is that you let people persuade you to stay in relationships that don't work out,"I  cheated on my  boyfriend, I know I'm horrible and I don't know how to continue on as myself"

328,If you are still on taking terms with him maybe letting him know how you feel might give you a sense of closure,: My ex sorta traumatized me and I feel like I cannot move past that trauma and I’m still holding on to it which makes me unwilling to trust other people. How long does it take to get over a relationship?

516,You’re overthinking this one,: is it normal for s/o to keep pictures of exes in social media?
518,I wouldn’t worry - sometimes people like to keep the pictures for the memory,My  girlfriend  keeps pictures of her exes on her social media. Is that normal?
520,At a certain point he's got to figure out how to handle himself when he's got nothing to do,: my boyfriend is working on not drinking anymore and now he’s bored with no hobbies to do at home and I don’t know if I’m responsible for helping him find things to do.
522,He has to find his own thing,I  feel personally responsible for my boyfriends  well being and happiness
524,"I think instead of hiding your other passions and hobbies, you should bring them forward",": despite engaging in his hobbies and passions, my boyfriend's engagement and interest in mine has progressively gone down in the last year (2 years together), even when I try to bring them forward to him. It has made me now less open about my passions and makes me hide them even more. He doesn't do this any of this on purpose though, I believe. What can I do?"
525,Hahaha probably he was burnt out as I would have an analysis or critique on average once every 2-3 weeks,"I think instead of hiding your other passions and hobbies, you should bring them forward"
526,"If being interested in art critique is something you need in a relationship, then you should break up",My  boyfriend  is showing less and less interest in my hobbies and passions even though I still engage with his. What can I do?
527,Art critique was just an example,"If being interested in art critique is something you need in a relationship, then you should break up"
528,Sometimes it's hard for people when they are shy,"I’ve talked to my gf about my needs as far as compliments and initiating sex, but she isn’t meeting them and I’m tired of mentioning and scared that if I do anymore that it won’t mean anything because I had to say something first."
529,I give her compliments quite a bit,Sometimes it's hard for people when they are shy

535,I find that idea rather odd to be honest,"I think you should have a talk with him about how he's acting, and that it's bothering you — especially the ""work wife"" comment, that's IMO inappropriate from someone who's already in a relationship"
536,Either way your partner deserves to know,"Due to PTSD, I haven’t had sex with my boyfriend pretty much since the beginning of our relationship but I want to change it now."
540,Has she tried hypnosis?,"- sister has extreme anxiety, keeps my parents all night when she can't sleep, how do I help her?"

550,I'd ask her if she ever intended to pay you back,My fiancee owes me money but she doesn't want to pay me.
552,"I mean she was clear that she wanted to take things slow and that’s what she is doing? If you want more, straight away she is not the girl for you, she isn’t ready or willing and that’s fine, it’s her choice and she warned you, don’t start getting annoyed",New girlfriend(26F) wants to meet me(26M) only once every two weeks.
553,Thanks a lot,"I mean she was clear that she wanted to take things slow and that’s what she is doing? If you want more, straight away she is not the girl for you, she isn’t ready or willing and that’s fine, it’s her choice and she warned you, don’t start getting annoyed"
556,First of all,basically I might have ruined something great with an amazing woman and am looking for advice and whether or not I have a chance. I am very serious about continuing therapy and working to better myself and regain her trust.
557,Well apparently i always looked suspicious on my phone because I would exit out of whatever app I was on when she'd come back from like the bathroom,First of all
560,I don't think it's an issue of you being jealous or insecure that he doesn't love you,": ""Girl that used to like my bf stayed after everyone left, I felt excluded because they talked for three hours about topics I couldn't talk about, I felt angry, and now I'm confused"""

572,"Tell him “I don’t care what timeline you have, I’m excited for our future together and I’m in no rush",": My mum told me that I have to get married by the end of this year at the latest. Should I let my boyfriend know what she's been saying (to give him a heads up, in case she tries to pressure him directly) or would telling him cause more tension and stress?"
574,"Tell her *once* ""Mom, we'll get married once we are good and ready, and when we get engaged you'll be the first to know, but until then I *need* you to stop pressuring me",My mum gave me a deadline to get married
576,I think giving her space until she’s ready to talk is the right call here,": So in summary, my girlfriend is going through something, but she doesn’t want to talk about it to me. I don’t know if it’s regarding the relationship or not (I think so). And because of the situation, she doesn’t want to see me irl."
577,Yeah that’s what I’m gonna do,I think giving her space until she’s ready to talk is the right call here

588,You brought it up,": Husband changed his mind to cover a tattoo of an ex baby mama after I agreed to cover some of my late husband, saying he was “just fucking with me.” The cover-ups were his idea to begin with."
589,Did you read the post? I was referring to some of the tattoos he had elsewhere - like the ones on his hands,You brought it up
590,I have never thought it was a good idea to get names tattooed on the body,My  husband  changed his mind
591,A lot of tattoo artists have rules about name tattoos simply because the number of people with acrimonious exes' names tattooed on their flesh for all time is too damn high,I have never thought it was a good idea to get names tattooed on the body
592,If you are unhappy and you can change it there is no reason to stay unhappy,"\*\* Bf cheated emotionally a couple of years ago (sent dirty messages and pictures to another guy).

598,"Maybe she regretted it and realized that you guys can’t be friends because you still have feelings and she doesn’t, but wasn’t going to kick you out or whatever","Ex invited me to hang with her and her friends, felt alienated"
599,"It's just more confusing given the fact that she's very blunt (I am too, but maybe slightly less than her) and doesn't sugarcoat things","Maybe she regretted it and realized that you guys can’t be friends because you still have feelings and she doesn’t, but wasn’t going to kick you out or whatever"

660,I think maybe it’s more of an acceptance thing,: My partner has way more friends than me and really likes to go out and have fun.
