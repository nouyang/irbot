360,Well think of it like this,"! - Boyfriend takes hours to reply to texts and I begin to feel unwanted and not respected because of that. He also doesn't find it necessarily to get back to his family (mother, sister) in a decent amount of time, as he enjoys to live in the moment and doesn't like the feeling of being restricted of his freedom."

How do I move on from this girl that I have never even been in a relationship with.
368,Have you told him how you feel about the picture thing? You should really talk to him about that first and see if he’s willing to stop? I I know some guys will probably say you’re overreacting but if you have past trauma with your previous relationships he should understand,I struggle with extremly jealousy for minor stuff and want to become better so it wont ruin my entire day everytime it happens.
370,But honestly just be confident with yourself that’s really important,"I struggle with extreme jealousy, and intrusive thoughts about my bf"

394,I think you covered it,Can I overcome resentment? 7 years near the end.
396,If you are still on taking terms with him maybe letting him know how you feel might give you a sense of closure,My ex sorta traumatized me and I feel like I cannot move past that trauma and I’m still holding on to it which makes me unwilling to trust other people. How long does it take to get over a relationship?

529,"Seriously, on again off again is reason enough to end it","God, stop with the on again off again"
530,Why are you living with him when you know he got the cat while you two were no longer dating? Why are you subjecting your son to whom you're supposed to be protecting and yourself to allergies and harm from an animal when it is within your power to prevent it? You chose to get back with this man and to move into his home or at the very least stay in his home multiple days a week when you knew he bought a cat,Reached my limit with boyfriends cat

532,It's natural to be curious about the people in your family,I tried to guess one of my cousin’s sexuality and told my other close cousin who I now realize might be in the closet. I feel weird about it and how it might’ve created a rift in our relationship.
534,It's okay to be curious! But please don't ask her any questions about it or make it seem like you're trying to make her come out to you,Am I weird for trying to guess someone’s sexuality? Advice pls.
536,"Sounds like your getting caught up on the concept of ""missing out""

The idea that it's your only chance to be single and explore relationships is a possibly a misplaced one, your probably not missing as much as you may think and there's plenty of time for that further down the line that's what you want to be doing","in college been in relationship for 2 years, love him but there are many things about him that make me realize I wouldn’t marry him, not sure if it’s fair to both of us to continue till the end of college."
538,Make a decision,"College relationship, unsure what to do"
540,>This relationship has turned toxic and I just want to save it,"boyfriend with extreme trust issues refuses to build trust with me based off past relationships. He constantly believes I am cheating on him, talking to other men, am up to no good when I have never been unloyal to him OR any other man in my life previously. I’ve done everything he has asked of me to help build trust, yet nothing has changed."
541,As someone who went through this with my ex,>This relationship has turned toxic and I just want to save it

549,I am kind to them and it took months of them not touching me for me to even vocalize that I was unhappy,This was horrifying to read
550,You and your partner are sexually incompatible,How do I deal with a lack of sexual validation in my relationship?
552,I would actually take the time to thank the person who sent me the video and ask about their relationship with him,"boyfriend is clearly looking elsewhere, how do I leave things?"

556,Do you think your family is even going to be receptive of you considering you ran off?,- About eight months ago I took off from my parents and I might be needing their help soon now even though I am much happier away

I hope so",Do you think your family is even going to be receptive of you considering you ran off?
558,"What sort of help are you wanting from them? Financial? Logistical? Housing? Is your current situation stable? How can you trust that if you put yourself in a position to rely on them (like living with them, counting on them for childcare, whatever), that they will treat you better than they did before? What happens if you put yourself and your baby in a position to be dependent upon their assistance, and then you're trapped in a bad situation? Like if you quit your current job to move back to your parents' house, and then you have no income of your own, and no ""escape"" plan, because you can't afford to move out?

I think it would be better to slowly open the lines of communication, work on building a new relationship with them, but don't ask for help or rely on them until you establish a new history together of trust, mutual respect, and good treatment of each other",About eight months ago I took off from my parents and I might be needing their help soon now even though I am much happier away

574,I wouldn’t worry - sometimes people like to keep the pictures for the memory,My  girlfriend  keeps pictures of her exes on her social media. Is that normal?
576,At a certain point he's got to figure out how to handle himself when he's got nothing to do,my boyfriend is working on not drinking anymore and now he’s bored with no hobbies to do at home and I don’t know if I’m responsible for helping him find things to do.

580,"If being interested in art critique is something you need in a relationship, then you should break up","despite engaging in his hobbies and passions, my boyfriend's engagement and interest in mine has progressively gone down in the last year (2 years together), even when I try to bring them forward to him. It has made me now less open about my passions and makes me hide them even more. He doesn't do this any of this on purpose though, I believe. What can I do?"

646,I have never thought it was a good idea to get names tattooed on the body,My  husband  changed his mind
647,A lot of tattoo artists have rules about name tattoos simply because the number of people with acrimonious exes' names tattooed on their flesh for all time is too damn high,I have never thought it was a good idea to get names tattooed on the body

654,"Maybe she regretted it and realized that you guys can’t be friends because you still have feelings and she doesn’t, but wasn’t going to kick you out or whatever","Ex invited me to hang with her and her friends, felt alienated"
655,"It's just more confusing given the fact that she's very blunt (I am too, but maybe slightly less than her) and doesn't sugarcoat things","Maybe she regretted it and realized that you guys can’t be friends because you still have feelings and she doesn’t, but wasn’t going to kick you out or whatever"

724,I think maybe it’s more of an acceptance thing,My partner has way more friends than me and really likes to go out and have fun. I’m worried my reaction to this difference is going to have an adverse affect on our relationship because of behaviours that may arise from feeling less than / unworthy.
725,It’s so odd though,I think maybe it’s more of an acceptance thing

740,Your relationship is toxic AF,My girlfriend made rules for what i can and can’t do but broke them and she can’t control her emotions and breaks down a lot about me doing things with other people especially when weed and alcohol are involved and she wants me to be around her all the time and she keeps shouting at me over things i can’t control and i feel like i need to live my life to please her to avoid hurting her or having her break down and hurt herself physically over me.

760,"As a general rule, you should never be especially concerned over the behavior of someone you’re *not* in a relationship with","an online friend messages my partner constantly, compliments their appearance, and frequently says they miss them - is this inappropriate?"
